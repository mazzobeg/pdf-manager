At 7[~]9 days post-tumor inoculation, the tumor grew to 5[~]10 mm,and ~50[~]75% tumor volume was treated by ultrasound-guided histotripsy, by delivering 1[~]2 cyclehistotripsy pulses at 100 Hz PRF (focal peak negative pressure P[~] >30 MPa), using a custom 1 MHztransducer. Complete local tumor regression was observed on MRI in 9/11 histotripsy-treated rats,with no local recurrence or metastasis up to the 12-week study end point, and only a <1 mm residualscar tissue observed on histology. In comparison, 100% of untreated control animals demonstratedlocal tumor progression, developed intrahepatic metastases, and were euthanized at 1[~]3 weeks.Survival outcomes in histotripsy-treated animals were signi[~]cantly improved compared to controls(p-value < 0.0001). There was evidence of potentially epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)in control tumor and tissue healing in histotripsy-treated tumors.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75% of all liver cancercases, most frequently occurring in patients with chronic liver diseases, from etiologies suchas hepatitis B and C, alcohol abuse, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD), resulting in cirrhosis [2]. The liver is also a frequent site formetastases originating from colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, lung cancer andbreast cancer [3]. Depending on the location, severity and staging of liver cancer, multipletreatment options are currently available, including surgical resection, liver transplantation,ablation techniques (including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA),high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryoablation), chemotherapy, radiation therapy,targeted drug therapy and immunotherapies [4]. Even with current medical treatments, the5-year patient survival rate in the United States is only 20%, the second lowest amongst allcancers [1]. Symptoms associated with liver cancer may not show at early stages, placingthe patients at an increased risk for nodal and distant metastases, which further lowerstheir 5-year survival rate to an estimated 3[~]11% [5]. Even after treatment, high prevalenceof tumor recurrence and metastasis [6] highlights the clinical need for improving outcomesof liver cancer. In fact, metastasis accounts for >90% of all cancer-associated deaths, andmetastatic progression is predominantly regulated by the complex signaling pathwaysbetween the primary tumor and stromal cells, especially the immune cells [7,8]."

Using high-pressure (P[~] > 15 MPa), microsecond-length ultrasound pulses, at a low duty cycle (ultrasoundon-time/total treatment time <1%), endogenous nanometer-scale gas nuclei in the tissue are ex-panded to over 100 [~]m, followed by collapse within several hundred microseconds, generatinghigh mechanical stress and strain to disrupt the cells in the target tissue. Histotripsy has beenshown to completely ablate the target tissue into a liquid consistency acellular homogenate,which is resorbed by the body within 2 months, leaving mm-length scar tissue [12[~]14]. Pre-clinical histotripsy investigations have established the feasibility and efficacy of histotripsy fornon-invasive ablation, in many pre-clinical applications, including the ablation of human-scaleporcine livers [15[~]19], and ablation of liver [20[~]22], kidney [23] and prostate [24] tumors. Themechanical strength of different tissue types impacts their resistance to histotripsy-induceddamage, which can be exploited by selecting optimal parameters for achieving tumor-selective damage, while simultaneously protecting the structural integrity of large bloodvessels, nerves, and bile ducts, within the ablation zone [15,17,18,25]."

In a murine melanoma model, histotripsy ablation of the primarysubcutaneous tumor inhibited the development of secondary pulmonary metastases, de-rived from tail vein injection [20]. In an orthotopic rat liver tumor model, histotripsy of theentire tumor volume resulted in complete regression of the tumor, in all subjects, and evenin 5/6 cases of partial tumor ablation (50[~]75% tumor volume ablated), the entire tumorregressed completely, with no recurrence [22]. Recently, a [~]rst-in-human trial demonstratedthe feasibility of planned histotripsy ablation of liver tumors, with no identi[~]ed seriousadverse events [26]. In all patients (n = 8), targeted tumors were locally controlled andin 2 of 8 patients, non-targeted tumors also stabilized [26]. These results suggest thatlocal histotripsy ablation of the entire primary tumor, or even a part of the tumor, maysystemically in[~]uence untargeted tumors. There is insuf[~]cient evidence regarding theeffects of histotripsy on the risk of recurrence and metastases following tumor debulking.Since histotripsy mechanically disrupts the tumor, it is possible that intact tumor cells mayinadvertently detach from the primary tumor and disseminate into the lymphatic and/orcirculatory system. Our understanding of the immunological response to histotripsy isalso limited, especially in cases of partial histotripsy ablation, where untargeted tumorvolume remains undamaged during treatment, but eventually regresses.

                "text": "Our rodent histotripsy setup (Figure 1a) consisted of a custom-built 1 MHz therapytransducer, co-aligned with a 20 MHz B-mode ultrasound imaging probe (L40-8/12, Ul-trasonix, Vancouver, Canada) mounted to a motorized 3-axis positioning system [22,27].The ring con[~]guration transducer (f number = 0.6, focal distance = 32.5 mm) contains8 individually focused lead zirconate titanate elements (20 mm diameter). The value ofpeak negative pressure in the tissue is estimated based on pressure measurements from[~]ber optic hydrophone in free-[~]eld [28]. In the free-[~]eld medium (degassed water), thepressure measurements from individual transducer elements were summed to calculate thepeak negative pressure (P[~]) of 37.8 MPa and the peak positive pressure (P+) of 43.9 MPa.The peak positive pressure may be underestimated without considering the non-linearitydeveloped when all elements are [~]red. However, the acoustic waveform at that high pres-sure with all elements [~]red simultaneously could not be measured due to instantaneouscavitation generation. The spatial peak temporal peak intensity (ISPTP) was estimated to be~130 kW/cm2, spatial peak pulse average intensity (ISPPA) was estimated to be ~24 kW/cm2and spatial peak temporal average (ISPTA) was estimated to be ~8 W/cm2. The transducerand imaging probe were immersed in a tank of degassed water maintained at 35[~]37 [~]C. Forhistotripsy treatment, animals were anesthetized by inhalation of iso[~]urane gas (1.5[~]2.0%)in 1 L/min of oxygen (SurgiVet V704001, Smiths Medical). The chest and abdominal regionswere shaved with an electric clipper. Carprofen (Rimadyl, P[~]zer, NY, USA) analgesic (5mg/kg) was used for analgesia prior to histotripsy and once every 24 h for two days post-ablation. The animal was placed on a custom-built platform over the tank such that the liverregion was submerged in the degassed water, which is the coupling medium (Figure 1a).Under ultrasound guidance, the therapy transducer was positioned to co-localize the focalzone of the therapy transducer focus with the tumor core. The entire tumor volume wasvisualized by scanning the imaging probe mounted on the motorized positioning system todetermine the limits of the intended target volume. In the scant histotripsy ablation cohort,<25% tumor volume was targeted for ablation. In all other animals receiving histotripsy,50[~]75% tumor volume was targeted. The desired fraction of tumor volume was targetedfor histotripsy ablation by mechanically scanning the histotripsy focus to cover the targetedvolume by using the motorized positioning system with continuous scan motion (scanvelocity ~6 mm/s). At each focal location within the target volume, the therapy transducerdelivered 1[~]2 cycle length histotripsy pulses (with a single high amplitude negative pres-sure phase) at 100 Hz PRF and generated peak negative pressure (P[~]) exceeding 30 MPa.P[~] >30 MPa exceeds the intrinsic threshold of the soft-tissue target (typically P[~] > 26 MPa)to generate inertial cavitation; this is the mechanism of intrinsic threshold histotripsy [28].During histotripsy, the generated cavitation appeared hyperechoic compared to the sur-rounding liver parenchyma on ultrasound imaging (Figure 1b). The size of the cavitationcloud was 1[~]3 mm. Post histotripsy-ablation, the targeted region appeared hypoechoic,indicative of tumor tissue disruption (Figure 1b). After treatment, animals were recovereduntil ambulatory. Total ablation time ranged from 3[~]5 min, at 100 Hz PRF equated to total18,000[~]30,000 pulses delivered to the intended target volume (ranging from 30 mm3 to 100"

The seed andsoil theory of metastasis was [~]rst proposed by Stephen Paget in 1889, which suggests thatthe metastatic growth of cancer cells (the [~]seed[~]) is dependent on the competence of thedistant organ (the [~]soil[~]) [33]. HCC is a highly invasive cancer, favoring proximal intra-hepatic metastasis, likely due to the dense hepatic vasculature and immunosuppressivepolarization of the liver [34].

EMT is a biologic process that allows epithelial cellsto transform into a mesenchymal cell phenotype, allowing them to migrate and in[~]ltrateand can be classi[~]ed into three biological subtypes. Of these, [~]type 2[~] are associated withwound healing and organ [~]brosis, and [~]type 3[~] are associated with tumor progression andmetastases [35]. EMT is characterized by the downregulation of epithelial markers, suchas E-cadherin, and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin andvimentin. In type 3 EMT, carcinoma cells, at the invasive front of primary tumors, canacquire a mesenchymal phenotype [36]. In our study, vimentin upregulation, observedat the periphery of control tumor on day 7, but not on day 2, is likely indicative of atype 3 EMT process. This premise is supported by the more invasive appearance of thetumor observed on day 7 trichrome staining, as well as the eventual invasive metastaticprogression observed in all control tumors at later timepoints. In contrast, type 2 EMT isinitiated as a reparative-associated process, in response to tissue injury or in[~]ammation,and ceases once the in[~]ammatory offense is withdrawn, such as with wound healingand [~]brosis [37]. However, within the liver, the contribution of type 2 EMT to [~]brosisis still controversial [38[~]40]. In general, vimentin is upregulated in the wound healingprocess; cytoskeletal vimentin is released extracellularly after tissue injury and binds tomesenchymal leader cells located at the wound edge to facilitate healing [41]."

This evidence suggests that the expression ofvimentin is likely linked to the formation of [~]brous tissue, as part of the wound healingprocess, in response to histotripsy ablation. Upregulation of E-cadherin, observed atthe tumor boundary on day 7, is likely indicative of re-epithelialization of the [~]wound[~],caused by histotripsy ablation; re-epithelialization is a necessary and essential requirementfor successful wound closure [42]. Since EMT may be involved in both tissue healingand metastasis processes, further investigation of the metastatic cascade is necessary.Intravasation of tumor cells generates circulating tumor cells (CTCs); however, it hasbeen estimated that only <0.01% of CTCs will develop distant metastatic lesions aftersurviving stress, immune attack and anoikis in a hostile circulatory system environment [43].Additional studies are ongoing to assess the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which willprovide an insight into whether the mechanical disruption caused by histotripsy increasesCTCs, as compared to untreated controls."

Cancer therapies, such as radiation, chemotherapy and thermal ablation, destroytumors and surrounding tissues via necrosis, which can trigger an in[~]ammatory immuneresponse. However, this response can be either pro-tumor or anti-tumor, depending on thetumor microenvironment and the expression of immune mediators and modulators [44[~]47].Our previous study demonstrated that subcutaneous histotripsy ablation of melanomatumors in murine hosts releases tumor antigens, with preserved immunogenicity, initiat-ing both local (upregulation of intratumoral NK cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells,CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells), and systemic immune response, as evidenced by abscopalimmune effects [20]. In the current study, we observed increased immune in[~]ltration ofCD11b+ and NK cells in the histotripsy-treated orthotopic liver tumor boundary, comparedto control tumor at day 2 timepoint. At the day 7 timepoint, CD8+ T cells were also seenin[~]ltrating the tumor region from the periphery. CD11b+ myeloid cells, as well as NKcells, contribute to anti-tumor innate immunity, while CD8+ cells contribute to adaptiveimmune-mediated responses [48[~]50]. Studies have shown that enhanced T-cell response,generated by immunotherapy, can prevent metastasis in early-stage cancer patients [51].In a human colorectal cancer study, the absence of metastasis correlated with increasedexpression of T-cell proliferation and antigen presentation functions [52]. There is in-creasing evidence that ablative therapies can either positively or negatively impact tumorprogression and metastasis, by regulating both adaptive and innate immunity [53[~]56].

Another study reportedincreased metastatic potential of residual carcinoma after transarterial embolization, usingthe McA-RH7777 model [31]. The [~]rst in-human histotripsy study reported intrahepaticabscopal effects (reduction in non-targeted tumor lesions), following histotripsy ablationof a single liver tumor lesion in a colorectal cancer patient, with progressive, multiplemetastatic disease [26]. Our previous study, using the N1-S1 liver orthotopic tumor model,had demonstrated that the complete histotripsy ablation cohort had a 100% regressionrate; however, in the partial ablation cohort (50[~]75% tumor ablation), only 80% of animalsdemonstrated regression [22]. Similar results were observed in the current study; whenat least 50% tumor volume was ablated, >80% of the tumors completely regressed and noclinical recurrence/metastases were detected, indicating an anti-tumor immune response.However, in the scant histotripsy cohort (<25% tumor ablation), tumor progression wasobserved, suggesting that the anti-tumor immune response was too weak, as evidenced bythe diminished immune in[~]ltration.

Tumorprogression and metastasis are in[~]uenced by several molecular mechanisms and factors.The orthotopic implantation of McA-RH7777 cells, using cyclophosphamide for temporaryimmune suppression to promote tumor uptake [59], does not fully represent spontaneouslydeveloping tumors in the human liver. This study also did not utilize any immunomod-ulating drugs in combination with histotripsy. Although histotripsy alone resulted incomplete regression of the tumor in >80% animals, it would be worthwhile to explorethe response of histotripsy in combination with immunotherapies, since ablation-inducedimmune responses have been historically reported as inadequate in eliminating establishedtumors. The exact mechanism of cell death of the untargeted residual tumor, followingpartial ablation, is also unknown and is likely a combination of immunogenic cell deathmechanisms; further investigations are currently ongoing. Another limitation is that tu-mors in this study were treated at an early stage, before metastases were radiologicallyvisible. Future studies will utilize immunomodulatory adjuvants with histotripsy ablationto treat tumors in different stages of disease progression, including after the developmentof intrahepatic metastases, and monitor their response."
